        <div class="description"><h2>Description</h2></div>
        <p>A Cuban sandwich (Spanish: Sándwich cubano) is a variation of a ham and cheese sandwich that likely originated in cafes catering to Cuban workers
             in Tampa or Key West, two early Cuban immigrant communities in Florida centered on the cigar industry. Later on, Cuban exiles and expatriates 
             brought it to Miami, where it is also very popular. The sandwich is made with ham, (mojo) roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard, and sometimes salami on Cuban bread.
              Salami is included in Tampa, where there is a large Italian population, but is not usually included in South Florida.

            The Cuban sandwich is at the center of a long-running friendly rivalry between Miami and Tampa. 
            As part of that rivalry, the "Historic Tampa Cuban Sandwich" was designated the "signature sandwich of the city of Tampa" by the Tampa City Council in 2012.</p>

                <li>2 tablespoons (25g) vegetable oil or olive oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Sandwich filling</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>sliced roast pork (from above)</li>
                <li>1/4 to 1/3 pound (114g) thinly sliced smoked ham</li>
                <li>3/4 pound (340g) Swiss cheese, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 1/2 (312g) large "pickle barrel" pickles</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons (57g) butter, melted or 1/4 cup (49g) olive oil</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve the sugar, yeast, and salt in the lukewarm water (and olive oil, if you're using it).</li>
            <li>Add the flour and Pizza Dough Flavor, starting with 5 1/2 cups (660g) flour and adding more as necessary to make a soft, smooth dough.</li> 
            <li>Knead the dough (with your hands, a mixer, or your bread machine set on the dough cycle) until it's smooth and elastic, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or other container, cover it, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, whatever fits your schedule.</li>
            <li>Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into four pieces, for medium-crust pizza; or three pieces, for thicker crusts. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece, on a lightly greased surface, into a circle to fit a 12" pizza pan. 
                    Let the dough rest several times to relax it and make it more cooperative.
                    If you prefer a more artisan look to your crust, with scattered random air pockets throughout, hand-stretch the dough to size. 
                    Again, letting it rest periodically makes the job easier.</li>
            <li>Place the rounds on pizza pans; on baking sheets; or, if you have a pizza stone in your oven, on parchment. </li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 450°F. While it's heating, get out your toppings, which you've prepared ahead. 
                    Some possibilities include sliced pepperoni; sautéed mushrooms, onions, or peppers; cooked meats; olives; anchovies; and grated or shredded cheese.</li>
            <li>Brush each crust with a bit of olive oil; spread pizza or spaghetti sauce lightly over the surface, and let your guests add their favorite toppings.
                Sprinkle the top with grated cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizzas for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're golden brown, the toppings are hot and bubbly, and the cheese is melted. 
                    Remove the pizzas from the oven.</li>
            <li>Immediately transfer pizzas to a cooling rack, so their bottoms don't get soggy. 
                    After about 10 minutes (to allow the toppings to set), slice and serve; a pair of scissors is a great cutting tool.</li>
        </ol>
